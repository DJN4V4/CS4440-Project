# Process Synchronization
# Make a fast-food burger shop, and ensure orders are completed promptly and correctly
# In order to achieve synchronous tasks, we will ensure different order items are completed/started simultaneously
# Different dining scenarios will be made to keep things interesting
# Threads -> meats down, cook fries, prepare drinks, gather utensils, build burger, package everything, serve (transactions?)
# Additional Threass? -> have 2-3 cooks as threads
